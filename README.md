# Explore Python Fundamentals-Part 1: Manning-LiveProject

The series of projects work out Python skills and form sound mental models of fundamental aspects of Python.

## Project 1: Variables
[1.1. Explore the Problem with Immutable vs. Mutable Objects](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/1.1%20Explore%20the%20Problem%20with%20Immutable%20vs.%20Mutable%20Objects.ipynb)
- Explore the characteristics of Python variables by examining what happens when re-assigning a value or changing an element/s in lists or arrays.

[1.2. Test Hypotheses - Are Variables Containers or Labels](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/1.2%20Test%20Hypotheses%20-%20Are%20Variables%20Containers%20or%20Labels.ipynb)
- For understanding the nature of Python variables and aiding into debugging and cleaning codes, Python's built-in function id() returns an objectâ€™s integer identifier.
