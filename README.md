# Explore Python Fundamentals-Part 1: Manning-LiveProject

The series of projects work out Python skills and form sound mental models of fundamental aspects of Python.

## Project 1: Variables
[1.1. Explore the Problem with Immutable vs. Mutable Objects](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/1.1%20Explore%20the%20Problem%20with%20Immutable%20vs.%20Mutable%20Objects.ipynb)
- Explore the characteristics of Python variables by examining what happens when re-assigning a value or changing an element/s in lists or arrays.

[1.2. Test Hypotheses - Are Variables Containers or Labels](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/1.2%20Test%20Hypotheses%20-%20Are%20Variables%20Containers%20or%20Labels.ipynb)
- Python's built-in function id() returns an objectâ€™s integer identifier; it helps in understanding the nature of Python variables and debugging codes,

## Project 2: Objects & Methods
[2.1 Creating class using the 'type()' function](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/2.1%20Creating%20a%20Class%20using%20the%20'type(%20)'%20function.ipynb)
- Aside from Python's conventional way of constructing class objects, the 'type()' function offers an alternative of creating dynamic classes.

[2.2 Workflow: Exploring Objects and Instance Methods](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/2.2%20Workflow%20-%20Exploring%20Objects%20and%20Instance%20Methods.ipynb)
- In object-oriented programming, a class is a custom-designed plan or model that serves as a basis for generating objects. Classes allow for the combination of data and functionality into a single entity. When a new class is established, it produces a new kind of object, enabling the creation of new instances of that type. Each instance of a class can possess properties that are associated with it to keep track of its condition. Furthermore, class instances can possess methods (specified by their class) for altering their state.

## Project 3: Class Methods & Variable

[3.1 Workflow: Class Data](https://github.com/sjord01/Explore-Python-Fundamentals-Part-1-Manning-LiveProject/blob/main/3.1%20Workflow%20-%20Class%20Data-Copy1.ipynb)
- Explore about classes, attributes, and methods in Python, and how they can be used to define and manipulate objects in an OOP context.
- Leverage the benefit of using a mutable object (a list) as an attribute, instead of a scalar value, to  keep track of data across multiple instances of a class.
## Project 4: Inheritance
## Project 5: Iteration
